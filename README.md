This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

<h2>Hello! Welcome to my little side project</h2>

<h3>Project information</h3>

I wanted to learn React and more on front-end web development, which is why I started this project. I figured that a way to visualise where infectious COVID-19 people have been would be a fun and relevant way to start. 

This was website was done in React with Node.js to host the web server, particularly Express.js. Website was scrapped using Puppeteer Node.js API. Used Geocode module to reverse search Google Maps using the locations, which was returned in LatLng.

<h3>Miscellaneous information</h3>

What you see in this diagram are the public places visited by cases in the community during Infectious Period as of 23rd September 2020.

These public places had been visited for more than 30 minutes by the confirmed cases in the community. Data is only of the past 2 weeks due to the incubation period of COVID-19.
